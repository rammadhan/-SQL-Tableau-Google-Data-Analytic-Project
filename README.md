# Cyclistic Case Study
## INTRODUCTION
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. Until now, Cyclistic‚Äôs marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as¬†Casuals.¬†Customers who purchase annual memberships are¬†Members.

Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Director of Marketing Lily Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. She has set a clear goal: design marketing strategies aimed at converting Casuals into Members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how Members and Casuals differ. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

## ASK
Three questions will guide the future marketing program: 
- How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
- Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? 
- How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
